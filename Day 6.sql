    Effectively, distance=(totalTime-chargeTime)*chargeTime, or d=c(t-c), so
    we have a upside-down parable, for which we want to find the two points
    where distance>record (r):

    (t-c)c-r>0

    So let's find the two roots of this parable by completing the square
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square

    -c2+ct-r=0

    c2-ct=-r

    c2-ct-(t/2)2=(t/2)2-r

    (c+t/2)2=(t/2)2-r

    c+t/2 = Â±sqrt( (t/2)2-r )

    => first root:  c=0.5t+sqrt( (t/2)2-r )
       second root: c=0.5t-sqrt( (t/2)2-r )
